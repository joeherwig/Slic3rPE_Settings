# Slic3rPE_Settings
Repository for the Slic3r Prusa Edition Settings for Prusa i3 MK3

## Purpose
This repository is used to save my settings for different materials and use cases.
I try to find the best settings for dedicated filaments and want to share my experience with everybody who is interested.

## Useage

This repo is just a copy of the settings-path of Slic3rPE. So just take the zip and copy the desired files into the appropriate folder of your installation, which might be underneath Windows
```
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Slic3rPE>
```

## Your improvements
Whenever you can improve the settings, feel free to fork this repo and send me a pull request - or tell me where i can find your Slic3r ini settings and if possible i'll check and maybe add them.

Regards,

Joe
